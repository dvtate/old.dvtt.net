# old.dvtt.net
  This repo is for my [old] personal website. My current one, [dvtt.net](https://dvtt.net) is more streamlined for contact information and isn't as personalized.

  I first started develpment on this website in 2014. It was intended as a way for me to share a small program I made for math class, but I gradually got more advanced in web development and added more pages and drastically improved the appearance of the site. In 2016 I shifted focus towards lower level programming languages. I kept gradually adding material to this site until around 2018 when I decided to remove it from the internet.
